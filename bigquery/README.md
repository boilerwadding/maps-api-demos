## Synopsis

This project demonstrates how to perform simple geospatial queries against a Google BigQuery table that contains latitude, longitude data in columns. It demonstrates how to use the Google Maps API to present a visual interface for the queries and the query results. The code accompanies the a codelab which can be found at [Codelab URL]. The files are arranged in sequential order to demonstrate progress through the codelab, but if you want you can jump [straight in to the finished example] (step7/map.html "Finished example")

## Motivation

Illustrate some ways to work with and visualize geospatial and location data in BigQuery tables without needing specialized libraries, ETL workflows or spatial data formats.

## Installation

The repo consists of static HTML files that can be run from a local computer or any web server.

To get it working, you'll need to sign up for BigQuery and the Google Maps API. See the codelab for more detailed instructions, but the basic steps to get this running are:
- create a new project in the [Google Developer Console] (https://console.developers.google.com/ "Google Developer Console"), or use an existing project.
- [Sign up for BigQuery] (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sign-up, "BigQuery sign up page")
- enable the [BigQuery API] (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/bigquery-api-quickstart "BigQuery API quick start instructions") and the [Google Maps Javascript API] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/ "Google Maps API documentation") in the Developer Console.
- create a new API Key for use with the Google Maps API, with a Browser restriction.
- create OAuth 2.0 credentials for use with BigQuery.
- choose a BigQuery dataset to query. There are several public datasets with latitude/longitude data.
- modify the code to replace the placeholders for API keys, OAuth 2.0 credentials, and BigQuery dataset and table name parameters with your own specific values for these.


## API Reference

For a general overview of Google BigQuery see [What Is BigQuery?] (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/what-is-bigquery "What is BigQuery?")

You may find it helpful to refer to the [Google Maps API] (https://developers.google.com/maps/ "Google Maps API documentation") reference, the Google BigQuery reference, and the [Google Client API for JavaScript] (https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client "Google Client API for JavaScript") reference.
